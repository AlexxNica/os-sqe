How to use the image

Use MAC address patterns to:
* 10:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX - Start dnsmasq service
* cc:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX - Assign static IP address
    Ex:
        - 10:10:12:00:03:06 = 12.0.3.6 (dnsmasq is enabled)
        - cc:10:00:03:54:24 = 10.0.3.54/24 (dnsmasq is disabled)
        - cc:01:02:00:03:16 = 1.2.0.3/16 (dnsmasq is disabled)

If assigning ip address is turned ON all cloud-init services are disabled.
