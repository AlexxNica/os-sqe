Preperation:
    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/diskimage-builder
    git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/dib-utils
    pip install ./diskimage-builder
    export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/diskimage-builder/bin:$(pwd)/dib-utils/bin

Export the elements forlder:
    export ELEMENTS_PATH=<osqe-configs>/disk-image-builder/elements

Run:
     disk-image-create fedora vm selinux-permissive dnsmasq users ip-addresses -a amd64 -o imagename.qcow2


Use MAC address patterns to:
* 10:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX - Start dnsmasq service. Last 4 octets are IP address in HEX format.
    The IP address is used as address of a subnet. CIDR: /24.
* XX:10:XX:XX:XX:XX - Assign IP address to eth0. IP address is specified in last 4 octets.
    Ex:
        - 10:10:12:00:03:06 = 12.0.3.6 (dnsmasq is enabled, assigning ip address is turned ON)
        - 00:00:10:00:03:54 = 10.0.3.54 (dnsmasq is disabled, assigning ip address is turned OFF)
