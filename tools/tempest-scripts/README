tempest_configurator.sh - script which loads images to installed Openstack and create networks and routers needed for
testing. It requires openrc file in the same directory where it runs and not mandatory external_net file in the same
directory of format "192.168.10" - external network for floating IPs pool. If it doesn't find external_net file it
considers network 10.10.10 as default

tempest_unconfig.sh - removes all images and networks from installed Openstack and clean all configured with tempest.
It works, but not perfect, some parts may remain there.

tests_set - set of tempest tests to run. It could (and should) be regexp. For excluding use (?!*container*). If it's
empty or doesn't exist - all tests will run.

run_tempest_tests.sh - script actually running tempest tests (from tests_set file or all).
